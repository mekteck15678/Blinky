## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. 


Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. If there is a vulnerability pls creat request for fork make the changes directly to base, or propose in a string for a request of specific functionality if issues continue the process will be eliminated as for future additions they work better with 5-6 willing to add on the fly together then dispurse later
